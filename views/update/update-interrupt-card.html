      You will need the overseas entity's authentication code to file this update statement.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      If you need to request one, search for the overseas entity on the <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Companies House register</a>, then select 'Request an authentication code'. We'll send the code to the email address that we have on record for the overseas entity.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Verification checks</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      If there have been any changes to the overseas entity, its beneficial owners or managing officers, these changes must be verified by a UK-regulated agent. This must be done no more than 3 months before the date of this update statement.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      The UK-regulated agent will need to provide their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agent-assurance-codes" class="govuk-link">agent assurance code</a> to confirm they have authorisation to carry out verification checks.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      If you are not changing any information, you will not need to complete any verification checks.
